*DESCRIPTION* : For this task I created a Java program to read write and modify a text file
                I used Visual Studio Code as my editor and JDK to compile and run the program
                The program worked with a file called `example.txt` where I wrote text read it line by line
                and added more text using file handling classes like `FileWriter` and `FileReader`
                This task helped me practice Java learn file handling basics and use tools like VS Code effectively
